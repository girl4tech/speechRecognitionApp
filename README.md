# Speech Recognition App

![alt tag](https://github.com/karina001/speechRecognitionApp/blob/master/Screen%20Shot%202018-03-16%20at%2011.35.04%20PM.png)

## How It's Made:
For this app I leveraged the Speech Recognition global variable, that lives on top of the browser. The idea was to leverage the various properties of the speech recognition app to view and append the transcript that it returns as the user speaks into her computer microphone. However the app needs to be run through some sort of server as it cannot run through a static file. 

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, local host

## Lessons Learned:
In this project I learned a lot about different Javascript data structures and how to apply data structure best practices in order to program more efficiently.

## Examples:
Take a look at other examples that I have in my own portfolio:

**Caesar Cipher Shift Encoder:** https://github.com/karina001/ceasarCipher

**WuTangClan Name Generator:** https://github.com/karina001/baristacoffeeapp
